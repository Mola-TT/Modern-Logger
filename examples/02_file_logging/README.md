# File Logging Example

This example demonstrates how to save log messages to files using ModernLogger.

## What it shows

- Logging to both console and file simultaneously
- Creating file-only loggers (no console output)
- Automatic log file creation
- Reading and displaying log file contents

## How to run

```bash
cd examples/02_file_logging
python example.py
```

## Expected output

```

## Files created

After running this example, you'll find these log files:
- `example.log` - Contains logs from the dual console/file logger
- `file_only.log` - Contains logs from the file-only logger

## Key features demonstrated

- **Dual Output**: Messages can go to both console and file
- **File-Only Logging**: Some loggers can write only to files
- **Automatic File Creation**: Log files are created automatically
- **Persistent Storage**: Log messages are saved for later analysis

## Configuration options

```python
# Basic file logging
logger = ModernLogger(file="app.log")

# Both console and file
logger = ModernLogger(console=True, file="app.log")

# File-only (no console output)
logger = ModernLogger(console=False, file="app.log")
```
